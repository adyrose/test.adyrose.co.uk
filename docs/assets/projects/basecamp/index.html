		<p>I had been toying with the idea of learning React for a while and decided to dive in and code this commercial application using it. I really enjoyed developing with React, i found it intuitive, easy and challenging at the same time, but i love a challenge.</p>
		<p>The entire application is split into react resuable pages/areas/components functional components. To make the application stand out from the competition i used an animation library called react spring which implements physics based animations and definitely gives it an edge i feel.</p>
		<p>This application also incorporates registration, user account and payment subscriptions which involved talking (securely) to several different APIs and managing user sessions on the front end.</p>
		<p>I was part of an agile scrumban team working with backend & devops developers.</p>
