		<p>Roseworx is a Javascript and CSS responsive front end framework with all the tools needed to create a basic website. It also includes some more complex modules such as an animation library, parallax modules and a rich and diverse feature set of components to give an edge on a standard website.</p>
		<p>I solely created and coded this project so i could have an easy "get started" template for personal projects without the baggage of big frameworks such as bootstrap and foundation.</p>
		<p>I use this in all my personal projects and iv even implemented it in a live commercial web application for a company.</p>
		<p>Roseworx is never complete and i continue to improve / maintain it regularly in my spare time.</p>
