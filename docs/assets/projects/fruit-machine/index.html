		<h5 class="rwxt-text-center">Fruit Machine</h5>
		<p>A key personal focus point in my development career is 3d web graphics. Im very interested in this field and i personally think it is where the future of web development is headed as more and more devices can now handle the processing power needed to render these graphics.</p>
		<p>I coded this in my spare time using ThreeJS which was a steep learning curve. I learnt lots about the 3d space, geometries, textures, raycasting, etc and had great fun creating this fun and interactive version of a classic pub fruit machine.</p>
