		${require('/html/includes/spare-time-statement.html')}
		<p>This was my first E-Commerce website with quite a big initial scope. The client had specific requirements and also wanted to be able to edit the content themselves. They also wanted to keep expenditure low.</p>
		<p>For this webshop i decided to use wordpress as the content management system and woocommerce plugin for the shop side. I created a custom theme and added custom PHP hooks, Javascript and CSS to get it working as the client expected.</p>
		<p>I also set up the infrastructure for this which included; buying the domain name, setting up hosting space, installing wordpress and php on the web server, setting up SSL for secure connections, setting up the paypal integration, etc.</p>
