		<p>I enjoy coding alot and i feel i dont always need to financially benefit from a project.</p>
		<p>I was approached by a gentleman at work who was on the board of a charity whom were setting up a wine festival to raise money for the charity MS Society. They had an outdated website and felt an update was required in order to reach a wider audience and raise more funds.</p>
		<p>I was only to happy to help and offer my support / services for a good cause and ended up coding this sleek lookinng website with a unique "wine pouring effect" SVG animation and i was glad that i can use my skill for charitable causes.</p>
