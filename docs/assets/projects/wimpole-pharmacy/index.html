		<p>I created this simple one page website, complete with contact form, from scratch using basic html and css.</p>
		<p>Using my own front end framework <a href="https://roseworx.adyrose.co.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roseworx</a> i was able to create this website very quickly and also easily implement some sleek scroll transitions which give it a nice modern look and feel.</p>
