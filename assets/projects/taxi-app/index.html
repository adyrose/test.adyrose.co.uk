		<h5 class="rwxt-text-center">Taxi App</h5>
		<p>This project was quite bespoke and had a very specific use case. The company i worked for had invested in a video wall for the reception area. With clients coming to/from the office regularly, the company wanted a innovative way of efficiently ordering taxis for clients waiting.</p>
		<p>The video wall software could not natively support an application like this but could display a web page layer on it.</p>
		<p>There is 2 parts to this application, the administration screen for the front of house staff to use and the display page which displayed on the video wall so visitors could see it.</p>
		<p>The appliction has a PHP backend acting as a REST API with SQL database connectivity to store and retrieve data. The administration front end would then take the input from the receptionist and use the API to store the data entered. I coded an AJAX "pulse" on the display screen which checked the database for changes on an interval and if it detected any, it would then display the data on the video wall to the client.</p>
