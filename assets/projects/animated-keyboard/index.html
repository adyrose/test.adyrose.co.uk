		<p>Sometimes i get an idea in my head and in my spare time, like to play about with coding and push the limits on what i can develop</p>
		<p>Here i used the HTML5 canvas tag and experimented with moving objects through cubic bezier paths over easing timings to a final destination, which in this case form the shape of a keyboard. The keys react to mouse movement, click events and keyup events.</p>
